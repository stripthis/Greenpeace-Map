      <p>Mattel is the largest manufacturer in the global toy sector.[1] The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has its headquarters in El Segundo, California, USA. In 2010, the company realised net sales in the amount of US&#36;5.9 billion (&euro;4.4 billion).[2]</p> 
<p>Although Mattel sells merchandise in more than 150 countries around the world,[3] nearly 80% of sales are in the USA and Europe.[4]</p>
<p>Mattel's Girls & Boys brands accounted for nearly 60% of total sales in 2010.[5] These brands include Barbie fashion dolls and accessories, Disney Classics, games and puzzles, and Monster High, Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Toy Story and Batman products.[6]</p>
<p>Barbie is a cultural icon, having dominated the fashion doll market for half a century.</p> 
<h4>Paper policy</h4>
<h5>Own production</h5>
<p>'To date several Mattel brands have conducted pilot projects that incorporate sustainability attributes. [...] For example, our Barbie Thumbelina line of toys uses 100 percent <em>recyclable</em> [emphasis added] cardboard in packaging and provides instructions on how to recycle.'[7] The company's annual report, philanthropy and global citizenship reports have been printed on FSC-certified paper, and 'for other printed materials, we generally work with paper suppliers and the printers that can make recommendations on latest FSC-approved paper stocks.'[8]</p> 
<p>The company is working with third parties such as Amazon.com to eliminate unnecessary additional packaging for the shipping of products to consumers.[9]</p>
<p>These weak and limited initiatives from the world's largest toy manufacturer do not ensure that Mattel does not trade with companies involved in deforestation.</p>
<h5>Products manufactured by third parties or under license</h5>
<p>'Mattel's [Global Manufacturing Principles] apply to all parties that manufacture, assemble, license or distribute any product or packaging bearing any of Mattel's brands. [...] Environmental Protection: Facilities must have environmental programs in place to minimize their impact on the environment.'[10]</p>
<p>Mattel requires its own independent certification for all materials, including paper products such as packaging, to attest that they meet its standards in terms of the exclusion or limitation of a range of hazardous chemicals. This applies not only to its own manufacturing, but also to that of third parties and licensees.</p>
<p>However, Mattel does not require any of its third parties or licensees to avoid trade with companies involved in deforestation.</p>

        <h3>Forensic evidence links Mattel to Indonesian rainforest destruction</h3>
        <a name="matforensics"></a>
        <p>Mattel facilities in Indonesia specialise in the manufacture of dolls, largely focusing on production of its wide range of Barbie products and its other iconic doll characters.[11] In addition, Mattel is licensed by Disney to produce a large range of dolls from Disney films.[12]</p>
<p>China is a major manufacturing hub for Mattel-branded merchandise.[13] This includes Barbie products, as well as a wide range of other toy products from card games to scooters.[14]</p>
<p>Expert forensic testing reveals that MTH is regularly found in a wide range of Mattel packaging and paper products.[15] This evidence exposes Mattel's role in the destruction of Indonesia's rainforests.</p>

<p>Greenpeace investigations have uncovered trade links between APP and Mattel in Indonesia and China.</p>
<h4>Certification indicates that APP is a Mattel supplier</h4>
<p>Greenpeace has obtained certificates indicating that APP supplies packaging material for Mattel products.</p> 
<p>Mattel requires testing and certification for materials, including paper products such as packaging, to attest that they meet its standards in terms of the exclusion or limitation of a range of hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>APP's main mill for packaging board in Indonesia - PT Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Serang (IKPP), located on the island of Java - has received this certification for several of the paperboard brands[18] that it produces and trades both within Indonesia and to China. The mill is supplied by APP's pulp mills in Sumatra;[19] these source MTH from Indonesia's rainforests.[20]</p>
<p>Within China, APP's Ningbo mill has received Mattel certification for the production of playing card paper.[21]</p>
[Show photograph of certificates]
<h4>APP produces Barbie's rainforest packaging</h4>
<p>Greenpeace investigations have uncovered trade links between APP and Mattel's manufacturing facilities for Barbie in Indonesia. Further evidence shows trade links through other facilities.</p>
<h4>Barbie 'Made in Indonesia'[22]</h4>
<p>Mattel's Indonesia facilities produce a wide range of fashion dolls. These include dolls under Mattel's own Barbie brand, as well as the popular Monster High brand and special edition dolls - usually linked to movie and TV characters. The Indonesian facilities also manufacture Disney-branded dolls under license; these include the Princess doll range and the High School Musical range.</p>
<p>Greenpeace identified two Indonesian printers producing packaging for Mattel's 'Made in Indonesia' fashion dolls sold in Germany, Australia, the UK, the USA and elsewhere: Sansico and PT Bukit Muria Jaya (PT BMJ).[23]</p>
<p>Further investigations have uncovered the trade links between these companies and APP.[24]</p>
<p>Sansico[25] has facilities in Indonesia and claims to produce over 1 million items of packaging per week. Mattel is one of its principal clients, and Sansico has reportedly supplied printed packaging to the company for two decades.[26] This is primarily through Sansico's printing house, PT Printec II, which adjoins Mattel Indonesia's main production facility. According to confidential information, this Sansico facility is a customer of APP Indonesia. The printing house produces all kinds of packaging products for Mattel, including those licensed to Disney. Sansico's mill, PT Grafitec, also provides packaging to Mattel Indonesia.[27] </p>
<p>PT BMJ is part of the Indonesian Djarum Group and is one of the country's leading packaging producers across sectors.[28] According to confidential information, BMJ is a customer of APP Indonesia. </p>
<p>Forensic tests of Mattel packaging from these printers identify regular use of MTH.</p>
<h4>Barbie 'Made in Indonesia' is just the tip of the iceberg[29]</h4>
<p>Greenpeace's investigations of Mattel's fashion doll packaging is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of revealing the potential impact of Mattel on Indonesia's rainforests.</p>
<p>According to Mattel's '2007 GRI Report': 'The majority of our products, including outsourced production are manufactured in China.'[30]</p>
<p>Within China, Mattel manufactures products ranging from fashion dolls, games, puzzles and playing cards to Barbie accessories and other toy brands.[31] Most products are sold with packaging or include paper materials of some sort.</p>
<p>Forensic testing of packaging for Barbie fashion dolls 'Made in China' reveals a number of products containing MTH.[32]</p> 
<p>According to the company website,[33] APP's company Ningbo Asia Converting claims to produce packaging for a Barbie-branded scooter. Its sister company, Ningbo Asia Pulp & Paper, holds a Mattel certificate for playing card paperboard[34] and imports pulp from Indonesia.[35] UNO playing cards and packaging featuring Disney's character Winnie the Pooh have tested positive for MTH.[36] </p>
<p>APP is one of the largest manufacturers of paper products in China, and about one third of its paper and paperboard production is packaging.[37] In the absence of strong policy and specific safeguards, paper products from China or Indonesia have a high risk of being linked to APP and of driving destruction of Indonesia's rainforests.</p>
