  <h2><span class="app deforestation">Indonesia's future and international trade need not depend on deforestation. The Sinar Mas Group is the largest player in both Indonesia's pulp and palm oil sectors, and it could lead low-carbon growth by setting the bar for industry best practice. However, while the palm oil division (Golden Agri Resources, GAR) is showing corporate leadership, the pulp division (Asia Pulp & Paper, APP) remains stuck in a deforestation-dependent economic growth model. To secure Indonesia's shift to a low-carbon development pathway, the government must stop making forested land available for expansion.</span></h2>

       <li>Corporate consumers can drive low-carbon development by implementing policies to clean up their production and supply chains. This rewards responsible producers, by not unfairly subsidising environmentally irresponsible companies.</li>
       <li>The Sinar Mas Group – Indonesia’s leading player in both the pulp and palm oil sectors – can drive low-carbon development by adopting the palm oil division's new business development policy based on no deforestation or peatland development. Claims made by the pulp division of Sinar Mas indicate that substantial increases in plantation pulpwood yields can be made, resulting in little or no further land conversion being necessary to meet national production targets; despite this potential, the division continues to rely on deforestation.</li>
       <li>Government can drive low-carbon development by rewarding companies whose business models are based on forest conservation policies and high-efficiency yields. At the same time, companies that pursue illegal or destructive operations must be penalised through strong law enforcement.</li>

           <p>Corporate consumers can support low-carbon development by implementing policies to clean up their production and supply chains.</p>
           <p>Progressive companies are implementing policies to achieve a zero-deforestation footprint. This includes a set of requirements that suppliers must meet for all commodities linked to deforestation and peatland destruction.</p>
           <p>A growing number of corporate consumers who were buying products produced by APP, many identified in Greenpeace investigations, have now introduced policies that will eliminate products from companies linked to deforestation in their supply chains.

         <span class="caption">Indonesia must dramatically improve pulpwood yields within existing concessions</span>
       </div>
          <p>The Sinar Mas Group – Indonesia’s leading player in both the pulp and palm oil sectors – could drive low-carbon development by establishing industry best practice standards.</p> 
          <p>Industry statements supported by government policy documents indicate that – with increased yields as a primary objective – no additional allocation of land area to the pulp or palm oil sectors is necessary to achieve government production targets.<span class="footnotes">[2]</span> Historically, the Ministry of Forestry and other ministries have allocated vast areas of land to the pulp and palm oil sectors, which have been deforested but left unplanted or poorly managed. APP’s approach to economic growth in Indonesia, which is based on such deforestation-dependent expansion, is in direct contrast with the principles that underlie low-carbon development.</p>
          <p>Figures used consistently within Ministry of Forestry and other government documents show that existing industry-held landbanks could accommodate a fourfold increase in pulpwood plantation yields and a doubling in palm oil yields.<span class="footnotes">[3]</span></p> 
          <p>This demonstrates that, appropriately supported through government policy and regulation, an economically prosperous low-carbon development path for Indonesia does not need to come at the expense of its natural forests and peatlands.</p> 
          <p>What is missing is the political will within key ministries, notably the Ministry of Forestry, to bring about change and to stop making forested land available for expansion. 
           Both the pulp and palm oil sectors need to take some initiative to make the radical shift away from deforestation-dependent expansion. Signs of corporate leadership are being seen within the Sinar Mas Group, where the palm oil division, GAR, has set the bar for a progressive forest conservation policy 'to ensure that its palm oil operations have no deforestation footprint. Core to this is […] no development on peat lands'.<span class="footnotes">[4]</span></p>
          <p>Other players within Indonesia's pulp and palm oil sectors need to support low-carbon growth by following GAR's lead. GAR's sister company in the Sinar Mas Group, APP, has yet to have the business foresight to adopt such policies.<span class="footnotes">[5]</span></p>

       <h3>The case for a 'new development pathway' for Indonesia</h3>

       <p>Indonesia's President's vision for low-carbon development is being undermined by a weak, partial moratorium<span class="footnotes">[6]</span> on the allocation of new business concessions in areas of primary forest and peatland. This does not provide adequate scope to stem the conversion of rainforests and peatlands important to wildlife and climate stability: existing concession areas are not covered by the moratorium, and millions of hectares of rainforest are being rebranded as 'degraded lands' available for development.</p> 
       <p>The following elements are key to setting Indonesia on a truly low-carbon development pathway: (a) a clear vision of what development is necessary and desired; (b) a policy to make this a cross-cutting priority, integrating climate change, biodiversity protection and the economy; (c) respect for indigenous peoples and a commitment to ensure their rights are protected; (d) strong governance to ensure implementation of the new policies; (e) industry leadership and initiative to achieve world-class production standards; and (f) international financial support for forest protection and clean development.</p>
       <p>As a first step, the government must support companies whose business models are based on forest conservation policies and high-efficiency yields. At the same time, companies that pursue illegal or destructive operations must be penalised through strong law enforcement. Ultimately, key ministries – notably the Ministry of Forestry – must find the political will to stop making forested land and peatlands available for expansion.</p> 
       <p>A strong moratorium is a critical step towards implementing a meaningful low-carbon development plan. The government needs to extend the moratorium to ensure the protection of all peatlands and a temporary halt on all further natural forest clearance, not only in new areas, as currently planned, but also in existing concession areas. This should be followed by a review of existing concessions to establish whether they were granted in compliance with Indonesian law. These actions would provide the Indonesian government with the necessary opening to overhaul the land allocation process to ensure protection of ecological, biodiversity, social, legal and economic values.</p>
       <p>It would indeed be 'a new development pathway'.<span class="footnotes">[7]</span></p>
